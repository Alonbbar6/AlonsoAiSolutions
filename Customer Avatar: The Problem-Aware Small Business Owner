•

B → What They Do & Like

•
Top 3 Brands they wear: David prioritizes comfort, durability, and a professional but approachable look. He favors brands like Patagonia for its quality and understated style, Cole Haan for comfortable dress shoes that can handle long days, and L.L.Bean for casual weekend wear with the family. These brands reflect his values of practicality, quality, and a touch of classic style without being overly flashy.

•
1-2 Hobbies they have: When he can find the time, David enjoys woodworking in his garage, a hobby that allows him to create tangible things with his hands—a satisfying contrast to the often intangible nature of his service business. He also enjoys coaching his son’s Little League team, which connects him to his community and provides a much-needed mental break from work.

•
Top 5 Favorite movies: The Social Network, Moneyball, The Founder, Jerry Maguire, Office Space. These films resonate with his entrepreneurial journey, highlighting themes of ambition, strategy, the highs and lows of building something from nothing, and the occasional absurdity of the business world.

•
Top 5 Favorite books: The E-Myth Revisited by Michael E. Gerber, Profit First by Mike Michalowicz, Good to Great by Jim Collins, Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss, and Shoe Dog by Phil Knight. These books reflect his desire for practical business advice, financial stability, and inspiration from other successful entrepreneurs. 3


•
Top 5 visited websites: LinkedIn (for professional networking and industry news), The Wall Street Journal (for general business and economic updates), YouTube (for "how-to" videos related to both his business and hobbies), Reddit (specifically r/smallbusiness and r/Entrepreneur for commiseration and advice), and his local news website to stay connected with the community he serves.

•
Top 5 relevant social media influencers: He follows practical, no-nonsense business leaders and thinkers like Gary Vaynerchuk (for his raw motivation and marketing insights), Patrick Bet-David (for his strategic thinking and entrepreneurial content), Simon Sinek (for his insights on leadership and purpose), Ramit Sethi (for his direct approach to personal and business finance), and local business leaders in his city or region who share relevant, community-focused advice.

C → Why Are They

•
Main Personality Traits: David is resilient, determined, and fiercely independent. He started his business to be his own boss and build something of value. He is passionate about his work and deeply committed to his clients, but this often leads him to be a perfectionist and somewhat controlling over business operations. He is adaptable and a natural problem-solver, but he’s also feeling the strain of wearing too many hats. 4


•
5 Major Values They Hold:

1.
Integrity: Doing right by his clients and employees is non-negotiable.

2.
Freedom: The autonomy to make his own decisions and control his destiny is paramount.

3.
Family: Providing a stable and prosperous future for his family is his primary motivation.

4.
Community: He believes in the power of local business and strives to be a respected member of his community.

5.
Growth: He has a deep-seated desire to learn, improve, and grow both personally and professionally.



•
2 Major Life Victories:

1.
Leaving his stable 9-to-5 job to start his own business. It was a massive leap of faith that he is incredibly proud of, despite the ongoing challenges.

2.
Hiring his first full-time employee. This was a significant milestone that made the business feel "real" and validated his efforts, proving he could create jobs and build a team.



•
2 Major Life Failures:

1.
A failed business partnership early in his career. This experience left him with a deep-seated fear of losing control and a reluctance to trust others with his business vision.

2.
Missing key family moments due to work. He carries a persistent guilt about the sacrifices his family has made for his business, like missing school plays or being mentally checked-out during family dinners.



D → Smart Market Questions

•
What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling: "Did I make the right decision to go out on my own? Am I going to lose a key client? What if we have a slow month and I can't make payroll? My website looks so dated, I wonder how many customers I'm losing because of it. I know I need to do something about it, but I don't even know where to start. It feels like another thing on my endless to-do list that I just can't get to." 5


•
What are they secretly afraid of in life: He is secretly terrified of failure—not just the financial ruin, but the public humiliation of having to close his doors and go back to working for someone else. He fears letting down his family and employees who depend on him. He also has a nagging fear of stagnation; that his business will never grow beyond its current level and he’ll be stuck in this grind forever. 6


•
What are they angry about, and who are they angry at: He is angry at the complexity of the modern business landscape. He’s frustrated with how much time he has to spend on non-core business activities, like trying to figure out why his website is so slow or why it’s not showing up on Google. He’s angry at the large corporations with massive marketing budgets that seem to dominate the online space, making it harder for small businesses like his to compete. He’s also angry at himself for not being more tech-savvy and for letting his online presence fall so far behind.

•
Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:

1.
Lack of Time: He feels constantly pulled in a million directions, from client work and employee management to sales and administrative tasks. There’s never enough time to focus on strategic growth, let alone tackle a project as daunting as a new website.

2.
Operational Inefficiencies: He knows things could be running more smoothly. He sees bottlenecks and wasted time but feels too bogged down in the day-to-day to implement meaningful changes. His current website is a prime example—it’s a clunky, inefficient tool that creates more work than it saves.

3.
Feeling Overwhelmed by Technology: He knows a better online presence is crucial, but the thought of SEO, mobile optimization, and chatbots is completely overwhelming. He doesn’t know who to trust or what a fair price is, and he’s afraid of getting ripped off. 7




•
Biggest secret desire in life: To build a business that can run without his constant, hands-on involvement, giving him the financial freedom and time to be truly present with his family and pursue his own interests without guilt or anxiety.

•
Built-in bias to how they make decisions: He has a strong "do-it-yourself" bias because he believes no one will care about his business as much as he does. This often leads him to take on tasks he should delegate. He is also skeptical of "magic bullet" solutions and is wary of salespeople who make grand promises. He makes decisions based on perceived value, practicality, and a gut feeling of trust.

•
Common words or language unique to them: "Bandwidth," "fire drill," "wearing too many hats," "bootstrapping," "bottom line," "ROI," "value-add," "it is what it is."

•
Top 3 complaints about existing solutions: (He isn't aware of specific solutions yet, but he complains about the problems that solutions would solve):

1.
"My website is basically just an online brochure. It doesn't do anything for me. It doesn’t bring in leads, and it’s a pain to update."

2.
"I paid a guy a few thousand dollars to build this site a few years ago, and now I can’t even get ahold of him to make simple changes. I feel stuck."

3.
"I see my competitors’ websites, and they just look so much more professional. They have online booking and chat things. Mine just looks… amateur. It’s embarrassing."



E → Going Deep

•
Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions:

1.
Anxiety: A constant, low-grade hum of worry about cash flow, competition, and the future of the business.

2.
Frustration: A feeling of being stuck and overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tasks and the technical complexity of things he doesn’t understand.

3.
Inadequacy: A nagging feeling that he’s not smart enough or skilled enough to navigate the digital side of his business, leading to a sense of being left behind.



•
Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem:

1.
Relief: The immense weight of his website-related anxiety being lifted from his shoulders.

2.
Pride: The feeling of having a professional, modern online presence that accurately reflects the quality of his business and makes him proud to share his URL.

3.
Confidence: The renewed sense of being a capable, forward-thinking business owner who is taking control of his company’s future and competing effectively in the modern market.



•
Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World:

1.
"Hard work is the key to success, but it feels like it’s not enough anymore."

2.
"You have to spend money to make money, but I’m terrified of wasting it on the wrong things."

3.
"Technology is a double-edged sword; it creates opportunities, but it also makes things way too complicated for the average person."



•
Biggest Lifestyle Desire: To be able to take a real, two-week vacation with his family without constantly checking his phone, confident that his business is still running smoothly and generating leads in his absence.

F → Purchasing Habits

•
Top 3 Decision Triggers:

1.
Overwhelming Pain: Reaching a breaking point where the frustration and embarrassment of his current website become unbearable (e.g., after losing a potential client who mentioned the site looked unprofessional).

2.
A Trusted Recommendation: Hearing a fellow business owner he respects rave about a solution they used to solve a similar problem.

3.
Clear ROI: Seeing a clear, logical connection between an investment and a tangible business outcome (e.g., more leads, saved time, increased revenue).



•
Prior Purchases For This Pain: He has likely tried a few ineffective things. He might have paid a freelancer a small amount a few years ago for the initial website, or he may have attempted a DIY solution like Wix or Squarespace, only to become frustrated with the limitations and the time it consumed.

•
Price Tolerance For Offer: He is highly price-sensitive but understands that you get what you pay for. The $1,000 - $5,000 one-time fee is within his budget for a significant project, but it would need to be a well-justified investment. The $15 - $50 monthly subscription is very appealing as it represents a low-risk, manageable operational expense.

•
Time Horizon Of Solution: He wants a solution that is fast. He has been putting this off for so long that the pain is acute. The idea of a long, drawn-out web development process is a major deterrent. He wants to see results within weeks, not months.

G → Primary Wants

•
Wants to gain: More customers, a competitive edge, and peace of mind.

•
Wants to be: Seen as a professional and successful business owner, a leader in his local market.

•
Wants to do: Focus on his core business and what he does best, without being bogged down by technical distractions.

•
Wants to save: Time, money, and mental energy.

•
Wants to avoid: Getting ripped off, making a bad investment, looking foolish, and falling further behind his competition.

H → Empathy Map

•
Seeing: Competitors with sleek, modern websites that have chatbots and online appointment booking. His own website looking dated and unprofessional on his phone. A growing list of unread emails and a calendar packed with appointments. His kids asking why he’s always on his computer.

•
Thinking: "I need to do something about my website, but I don't have the time or energy to figure it out. Who can I even trust to do this? How much is this going to cost? What if I spend all this money and it doesn't even work? I feel like I'm failing at this part of the business."

•
Hearing: Customers saying, "I tried to find you online, but your website was hard to navigate." A podcast host talking about the importance of SEO and digital marketing. His wife asking when he’s going to take a break. The constant notification sounds from his phone.

•
Feeling: Overwhelmed, anxious, frustrated, and a little bit embarrassed. He feels a sense of responsibility for his employees and family, which adds to the pressure. He’s also hopeful and determined, but that optimism is being worn down by the daily grind.

•
Saying: "I’m just too busy to deal with that right now." "We’re doing fine with word-of-mouth." (even though he knows it’s not enough). "I’ll get to it eventually." "I just need to find someone I can trust."

•
Doing: Working long hours, often 50-60+ per week. 8
 Answering emails at all hours. Putting out fires. Networking in person because he’s not confident in his online presence. Procrastinating on tackling the website problem because it feels too big and complex.
